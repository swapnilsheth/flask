1/23/20, 10:56 AM - Manan: ALL visits to Havasupai and Havasu Falls require a reservation made PRIOR to arrival.

There is only ONE name on a Campground Reservation - and a reservation is only valid if the person named on the reservation (the "Trip Leader") is present at the Tourist Check-in Office in the Village of Supai (on the way to the Campground) with valid photo ID - otherwise the reservation is NOT valid and will NOT be honored.

ALL visitors (even if they are not a Trip Leader) must have an account here on HavasupaiReservations.com made PRIOR to arrival so that they have confirmed their understanding of, and agreement with, Havasupai Rules and Laws.

ALL visitors must have proof of their account (a printout or screenshot of their Account Information Page), proof of their Campground Reservation (a printout or screenshot of the Campground Reservation that they are visiting under), and their photo ID available at all times while on Havasupai lands.

5/12/20, 1:19 PM - Rishi Pancholi: Ppl should  get out if they comfortable.  Shud b own choice.
5/12/20, 1:23 PM - Manan: Agree
5/12/20, 1:48 PM - Shruti Vora: That would be risky and it will flood up the hospitals
5/12/20, 1:49 PM - Manan: Saars have no vaccine yet...LL be wishful thinking to have vaccine for covid-19 too soon
5/12/20, 1:49 PM - Manan: Med LL b there ..so as covid-19..both r here to stay
5/12/20, 1:49 PM - Swapnil Sheth: Yeah yaar, Germany saw a big spike in new cases after opening up. China is forcing all residents of wuhan 11m people to get tested after they saw 6 new cases
5/12/20, 1:49 PM - Swapnil Sheth: Vaccine is the only way to get this under control
5/12/20, 1:50 PM - Rishi Pancholi: Yes that's why I said . It  should be own  choice.
5/12/20, 1:51 PM - Swapnil Sheth: But then what if people who make this choice accidentally infect other people
5/12/20, 1:51 PM - Rishi Pancholi: Cases are sharply  declining  tho. 20 k and 18k yest.  Compare to last week was 38 and 40k
5/12/20, 1:51 PM - Shruti Vora: Things don't get better by providing the choice! People went to beach without any social distancing and masks and now hospitals see rise in cases!
5/12/20, 1:52 PM - Rishi Pancholi: Self awareness  is important going forward  as well honesty.  If one sick has to stay home
5/12/20, 1:53 PM - Manan: Yes but think..for how long daily wage earners and illegal workers stays without work??
5/12/20, 1:53 PM - Rishi Pancholi: Agreed.   But since it's open. It is still ppl choice.  If this last next 2 years like h1n1   ,ppl has to live with it like all nation are saying
5/12/20, 1:54 PM - Manan: And this country runs on illegal workers
5/12/20, 1:54 PM - Shruti Vora: Symptoms are visible after 7-8 days. So if someone has covid without symptoms and will go out, they can infect weak people!
5/12/20, 1:54 PM - Rishi Pancholi: I agree.  But what  are the choices
5/12/20, 1:55 PM - Manan: Ppl 's immunity will get strong by going out and exposing things..not saying they HV to expose to covid-19..but in general case...you have to take a hit to get stronger
5/12/20, 1:55 PM - Manan: We all have jobs ..so we are ok staying home..but for poor ppl in India or illegal Mexican worker...it's tough
5/12/20, 1:56 PM - Manan: Think about illegal Mexican worker..with no money
5/12/20, 1:56 PM - Rishi Pancholi: Tough time
5/12/20, 1:56 PM - Manan: They are more at risk by going out...without insurance but papi pet ka sawal hai
5/12/20, 1:56 PM - Swapnil Sheth: yeah, its unfortunate. People will automaically resist following rules of this goes long enough.
5/12/20, 1:57 PM - Rishi Pancholi: Plus how long gov can pay  ppl  for all those 15% unemployment
5/12/20, 1:58 PM - Manan: Even today modi announced that they have to open up.mcant keep ppl home
5/12/20, 1:59 PM - Rishi Pancholi: America was never actually  lockdown
5/12/20, 1:59 PM - Manan: You have to open up and let ppl decide what's better for them
5/12/20, 1:59 PM - Manan: Ppl will find a way to keep covid-19 away
5/12/20, 2:00 PM - Rishi Pancholi: Hu ukli  gayo  to mara namni  wine pi lejo

5/29/20, 7:58 AM - Manan: N shruto

5/29/20, 7:58 AM - Manan: I think so
5/29/20, 7:59 AM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: N shruti *
5/29/20, 7:59 AM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: Yesha are you ok with that ?
5/29/20, 8:46 AM - Manan: I The number of deaths in the world in the last 3 months of 2020

      3,14,687 : Corona virus

      3,69,602 : Common cold

      3,40,584 : Malaria

     3,53,696 : suicide

     3,93,479 : road accidents

     2,40,950 : HIV 

     5,58,471 : alcohol

     8,16,498 : smoking

  11,67,714: Cancer

 Then do you think Corona is dangerous? 

 Or

is the purpose of the media campaign to settle the trade war between China and America 

or

to reduce financial markets to prepare the stage of financial markets for mergers and acquisitions 

or 

to sell US Treasury bonds to cover the fiscal deficit in them

Or

Is it a Panic created by Pharma companies to sell their products like sanitizer, masks, medicine etc.

Do not Panic & don't kill yourself with unecessary fear. This posting is to balance your newsfeed from posts that caused fear and panic. 

 33,38,724 People are sick with Coronavirus at the moment, of which 32,00,000 are abroad. This means that if you are not in or haven't recently visited any foreign country, this should eliminate 95% of your concern.

If you do contact Coronavirus, this still is not a cause for panic because:

81% of the Cases are MILD

14% of the Cases are MODERATE

Only 5% of the Cases are CRITICAL

Which means that even if you do get the virus, you are most likely to recover from it.

Some have said, ‚Äúbut this is worse than SARS and SWINEFLU!‚Äù  SARS had a fatality rate of 10%, Swine flu 28% while COVID-19 has a fatality rate of 2%

Moreover, looking at the ages of those who are dying of this virus, the death rate for the people UNDER 55 years of age is only 0.4%

This means that: if you are under 55 years of age and don't live out of India - you are more likely to win the lottery (which has a 1 in 45,000,000 chance)
Let's take one day ie 1 May as an example when Covid 19 took lives of 6406 in the world.
On the same day:

26,283 people died of Cancer

24,641 people died of Heart Disease

4,300 people died of Diabetes

Suicide took 28 times more lives than the virus did.

Mosquitoes kill 2,740 people every day, HUMANS kill 1,300 fellow humans every day, and Snakes kill 137 people every day. (Sharks kill 2 people a year)

SO DO THE DAILY THINGS TO SUPPORT YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM , PROPER HYGIENE AND DO NOT LIVE  IN FEAR.

Join to Spread *Hope* instead of Fear. 

The Biggest Virus is not Corona Virus but Fear!

6/1/20, 7:01 PM - Shruti Vora: Its $40 /couple extra but peace of mind as covid-19 cases are expected to go up within 2 weeks because of all the protests going on
6/1/20, 7:02 PM - Shruti Vora: So there might be some restrictions for traveling
6/1/20, 7:02 PM - Manan: Bahamas plan Karo Bhai logüòÇüòÇüòÇ

6/1/20, 7:09 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: you are looking to book a trip now, please consider some of these best practices:
Consider purchasing travel insurance. Travel insurance may provide coverage for illness due to COVID-19 should you be diagnosed and prevented from travel at the time of your departure. It may not provide coverage for travel bans, shelter in place orders, or fear of travel. Be sure to carefully read the policy coverage for details.
6/1/20, 7:09 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: See above üëÜ
6/1/20, 7:10 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: It may not provide coverage for bans..so I will have to call and check

6/13/20, 10:12 AM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: So that is why they are renting for cheap all adding extra will cost
6/13/20, 10:12 AM - Rishi Pancholi: Its risky without  insurance
6/13/20, 10:12 AM - Sonali Patel: So I have had 2 bad experience with avr rental, they will try to force you to buy their insurance and will try to charge you for second driver
6/13/20, 10:12 AM - Karan: Even other company insurance is extra
6/13/20, 10:13 AM - Sonali Patel: You have to argue with them, then they'll let you go
6/13/20, 10:13 AM - Rishi Pancholi: Costco  best option
6/13/20, 10:13 AM - Manan: No need for insurance
6/13/20, 10:13 AM - Sonali Patel: Your auto insurance policy cover rental cars
6/13/20, 10:13 AM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Karan, so we will have deductible through their insurance too right?
6/13/20, 10:13 AM - Rishi Pancholi: Not everything. Still deductible
6/13/20, 10:14 AM - Karan: Anytime I rent vehicles I never buy insurance or add extra driver I never had any issues

6/13/20, 10:15 AM - Manan: Honestly no need to spend for extra driver or insurance.. spend money in Tahoe for activity or flood or drink
6/13/20, 10:15 AM - Rishi Pancholi: Costco  wud be better choice  just bit expensive
6/13/20, 10:15 AM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Yeah I agree
6/13/20, 10:15 AM - Sonali Patel: Avr, is not a good company, they will try to force you to buy their insurance so whoever picks up the cars will need to be firm with no

6/15/20, 11:08 AM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: So for thurday night dinner are we doing pulav or khichadi I m asking if we are making egg curry on thurday or not ?

6/15/20, 11:11 AM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: Same only with mask on üò∑
6/15/20, 1:19 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: So my CC covers rental. However, vans carrying more than 9 people are excluded
6/15/20, 1:20 PM - Manan: V HV 9 ppl in each van
6/15/20, 1:20 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: @16263749249  it only covers the renter under the contract and any authorized drivers permitted by rental agreement
6/15/20, 1:20 PM - Manan: 1 family with 2 kids, 1 family with 1 kid and 1 family with no kid in each van
6/15/20, 1:20 PM - Manan: 9 in each
6/15/20, 1:21 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: So the language says "vans designed to carry more than 9 people". I read it as the van capacity irrespective of how many ppl are in it
6/15/20, 1:21 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: But I can try calling and checking on that lingo
6/15/20, 1:21 PM - Manan: Yeah
6/15/20, 1:21 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: But I am fairly sure they are talking about the type of van
6/15/20, 1:22 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Coz it says exotic and antique vehicles are also not covered
6/15/20, 1:22 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: Ok what is exotic vehicleüòè
6/15/20, 1:23 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Something we can't afford üòÜ
6/15/20, 1:23 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: Hahaha
6/15/20, 1:23 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: So they are describing the types of vehicles that won't be covered
6/15/20, 1:23 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: I think our van should be ok
6/15/20, 1:23 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: You might want to check with your insurance and cc
6/15/20, 1:26 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: My guess is our insurance won't cover this type of rental either
6/15/20, 1:26 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: It will come with caveats of it's own
6/15/20, 1:28 PM - Shruti Vora: Yes! As it is a bigger vehicle than we have our usual insurance, they won't cover it
6/15/20, 1:30 PM - Karan: This is correct they will not cover bigger vehicle.
6/15/20, 1:30 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: Ok insurance is concern what everyone wants to do then ?
6/15/20, 1:30 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Ok so now what?

6/15/20, 1:32 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Go with our plan B
6/15/20, 1:32 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: If that can be done but the. Luggage might b an issue
6/15/20, 1:33 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: Oh you mean 4 family n 2 family ?

6/15/20, 1:48 PM - Saurabh Desai: I vote to buy insurance and fine with $164 per couple or other option is 
If Manan takes his van I will join him or will take mine. Saurabh & Ami takes their van or suv. Rishi & Palak takes their suv. Dhaval & Karan can share car.
6/15/20, 1:55 PM - Manan: 4 car LL be too much to park on driveway .. I think.. I may be wrong also
6/15/20, 1:58 PM - Shruti Vora: <Media omitted>
6/15/20, 1:58 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: Should be ok n 3 mini van is not an option?
6/15/20, 1:59 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: 3 minivan ma badha aavi na jaay ?
6/15/20, 1:59 PM - Shruti Vora: Let's go with 4 cars. It will be more convenient
6/15/20, 1:59 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Yeah parking won't be an issue but I rather rent one 15 seater and have 4 families go with it
6/15/20, 1:59 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: And Nannu and Manan come in one car
6/15/20, 2:00 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: Ok
6/15/20, 2:00 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: If Manan is  still ok taking the van
6/15/20, 2:00 PM - Shruti Vora: Or let's spend $80/ family and stick to the plan
6/15/20, 2:01 PM - Shruti Vora: We can do cost cutting somewhere else
6/15/20, 2:02 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: 163 is ok by me for peice of mind since personal insurance not covering
6/15/20, 2:03 PM - Shruti Vora: Why is it $163m
6/15/20, 2:03 PM - Shruti Vora: ?
6/15/20, 2:03 PM - Saurabh Desai: We can always check with our own insurance. Each one might be little different. I will call Geico tonight
6/15/20, 2:03 PM - Shruti Vora: What is the cost for 2 cars?
6/15/20, 2:04 PM - Manan: Yeha
6/15/20, 2:04 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Plus the cost to add more drivers
6/15/20, 2:05 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: 241 each and 250 each for insurance
6/15/20, 2:05 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Because insurance will only cover the driver and spouse
6/15/20, 2:05 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Unless others are listed on the contract
6/15/20, 2:05 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Peace of mind ain't cheap üòÇ
6/15/20, 2:05 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: Lol

6/15/20, 2:10 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: üëç
6/15/20, 2:10 PM - Shruti Vora: 15 seater won't be comfortable for 12 people as we won't be able to use last 3 seats. Then we are left with 3 seats in each seat and with car seats, it won't be comfortable
6/15/20, 2:10 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: So additional driver is probably $15 per day per van
6/15/20, 2:10 PM - Manan: or one 15 seater and two vans
6/15/20, 2:10 PM - Manan: put luggage in 15 seater
6/15/20, 2:10 PM - Shruti Vora: That's fine

6/15/20, 2:11 PM - Shruti Vora: 7 seaters will be covered with our own insurance
6/15/20, 2:11 PM - Manan: yeah
6/15/20, 2:12 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: That is why ask why 3 minivan is not ok ?
6/15/20, 2:12 PM - Manan: 3 minivan should be ok too

6/15/20, 3:07 PM - Rishi Pancholi: Let's just take own car.  That's best cost saving option
6/15/20, 3:17 PM - Yesha: Let‚Äôs vote for both options and we can finalize
6/15/20, 3:17 PM - Manan: i am in for 15 seater...as i will be in ontario on wed night
6/15/20, 3:19 PM - Rishi Pancholi: My vote is 15 seater or take own car. As 2 couple can squeeze  in even  tho  small car
6/15/20, 3:23 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: Lets do call today meanwhile karandind out of you already paid for 15 seater or not ?

6/15/20, 4:36 PM - Manan: Like in Chino hills or in Glendale??
6/15/20, 4:36 PM - Yesha: We haven‚Äôt decided.. mostly we will come direct on early morning

6/15/20, 4:38 PM - Yesha: We need to make decision so we can think about next step
6/15/20, 4:38 PM - Yesha: Let‚Äôs do half an hour call today and decide
6/15/20, 4:42 PM - Manan: One thing can workout.. keep 1 15 seater... Rent/use one van and one 5 seater sedan/SUV... Us, Karan, n rishi can go in van... Out of three family... One or two member can go in van to support driver .. and one sedan/SUV will have 2-3 driver either way
6/15/20, 4:43 PM - Manan: Since van LL have 4-5 ppl.. we can use space for luggage... 15 seater will have 6-8 ppl.. other space can be use for luggage... Sedan/suv.. jus keep minimum luggage necessary for travel
6/15/20, 5:24 PM - Shruti Vora: This is getting too confusing now!
6/15/20, 5:32 PM - Rishi Pancholi: Ya I agree.  I nominate  2 group  leader manan and ami to  debate and come to conclusions
6/15/20, 5:32 PM - Rishi Pancholi: Too many hands in cookie jar
6/15/20, 5:36 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: If we forget the cost for a minute, I think everyone prefers (2) 15 seaters for entertainment purpose
6/15/20, 5:40 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Maybe we can agree on middle ground and buy insurance but no additional drivers
6/15/20, 5:42 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Personally I am ok with no insurance but we need to try and accommodate everyone
6/15/20, 5:42 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Please vote yes or no on this option before we introduce another option
6/15/20, 5:43 PM - Yesha: How much for additional driver it‚Äôs 20 or30?
6/15/20, 5:44 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Not sure but assume $30 per day per driver
6/15/20, 5:46 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: I m ok without insurance
6/15/20, 5:47 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Please vote yay or nay on this üëÜ
6/15/20, 5:47 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: Yes
6/15/20, 5:49 PM - Yesha: We are fine with this .. we need insurance.
6/15/20, 5:49 PM - Yesha: Yes
6/15/20, 5:51 PM - Shruti Vora: We are okay with it.
6/15/20, 5:56 PM - Manan: Yes means ok without insurance ??
6/15/20, 5:58 PM - Shruti Vora: No. With insurance without additional drivers
6/15/20, 6:00 PM - Yesha: I think most of are agreed with insurance and no additional drivers.. we can go with this approach
6/15/20, 6:12 PM - Manan: I think additional driver n insurance both are at same risk... But whatever majority agrees
6/15/20, 6:20 PM - Rishi Pancholi: As of today I dug 2 ft  in my backyard and drop  few dollar coins pound  and some dinars.  Let me vote in few days üòÑ

6/15/20, 7:03 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Don't think so...
Honestly I think some of us might have driven 8 hours single handedly. We have spouse included and may only need to switch for short periods
6/15/20, 7:03 PM - Manan: Agree
6/15/20, 7:06 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Only issue is driver has to take the blame if something happens when another driver is on the front wheel, but then again do we really want to open another can of worms?
6/15/20, 7:07 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Looks like Manan and Karan - we are waiting on your thoughts

2. If u watch only ZeeTV, Republic, News X, Republic Bharat, India TV and Bharatvarsh - You will think India is the new major Military-Economic World Leader under PM Modi and our new capital is going to be in Islamabad.

3. If u watch all of them - You will be a confused man, will be posting garbage forwards and will not know whether to panic or chill.

4. If u watch porn - You will be at peace and in nirvana.

*Please choose wisely.*

7/10/20, 5:05 PM - Manan: Yeah .. take it as flu
7/10/20, 5:06 PM - Manan: But think when max cases were in 40-50k... Govt closed everything
7/10/20, 5:06 PM - Shruti Vora: We can take it as flu once vaccine is out

7/10/20, 5:19 PM - Rishi Pancholi: Ppl job at stake. Now either  die  hungry  or die  with virus situation.  Specially  gov taking away extra 600$ for un employment.  Not everyone  in same boat.  Tough  call

7/10/20, 5:19 PM - Manan: Can't sit home till vaccine is out... Vaccine LL be billion dollar business
7/10/20, 5:29 PM - Shruti Vora: I agree. Businesses need to reopen and schools/daycare centers too. But then people need to pick and choose. Like go to work and come back. Dont go to beaches and parks and other crowded places or have big get to gathers!

7/10/20, 5:41 PM - Manan: Curbside pickup is only 10% of routine business... Some restaurants are locations based...
7/10/20, 5:41 PM - Manan: Beach n parks can open but for active use only
7/10/20, 5:46 PM - Rishi Pancholi: All rules are discarded  moment one has to goto work. We are in difficult  time.
7/10/20, 5:47 PM - Rishi Pancholi: Question  is how long one can sit in home? If this goes to 2 or 3 year  like h1n1,  mental  impact  can be more severe

If I see a bunch of African-American and Hispanic people, my guard is definitely up. If I see a bunch of white, yellow people my card is not.  But that is true everywhere, it will always be a group of people who will be marginalized on a group of people who are not.  Is this right? No in theory definitely not but in practicality and in life it is it's sad but it's true.  I think the important thing is awareness and to be aware of our actions and how it can affect other people

I took the 15 north and got off on the main road which is Phelan road and just drove west a bit until I found a side dirt road with a few trees.   I wanted to get away from the city lights.  Hesperia is not too far.  There are scattered Joshua trees around.  I have been to the Joshua Tree National Park which has a square miles of these trees.

7/20/20, 8:35 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: If you really want optimal viewing conditions, Dark Site Finder lists Mojave National Preserve and Joshua Tree National Park dark sites. Closer to home, we‚Äôd typically recommend areas within the Santa Monica Mountains, along the beach near the Ventura County line and around parts of the Palos Verdes Peninsula, according to this light pollution map‚Äîbut, depending on how deep into the mountains you head, hills along the horizon might block your early-week view in all but Palos Verdes.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=AjUReywzmFg

San Francisco passed resolution against India

They are on crusade against India

Joe Biden has been consistently raising anti India Kashmir issues. Biden's media manager is of Pakistani origin.
We should all expose Biden and all the Democrats on this issue.
I urge all my good friends to share this  post with other groups and everyone they may know in the US, even if they may not be US citizens. We can at least spread the word on how Democrats view India's security interests.

Imagine a US president with a Pakistani by his side while India is on the cusp of a two front war with China and Pakistan.

All Indian Amecian needs to vote for Trump

They tried this shit in Uk and all Indians voted conservative and labor got there ass kicked.

9/7/20, 6:06 PM - Manan: I love this Story, üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

A woman went shopping. At the cash counter, she opened her purse to pay. 

The cashier noticed a TV remote in her purse.

He could not control his curiosity and asked,

"Do you always carry your TV remote with you?üòï"

She replied " No, not always, but my husband refused to accompany me shopping today because of football match, so I took the remote."

*Moral: Accompany and support your wife in her hobbies.....*üôçüôçüôçüôçüôçüôçüôç

The story continues....üòè

The cashier laughed and then returned all the items that lady had purchased.

Shocked at this act, she asked the cashier what he was doing.

He said, "your husband has blocked your credit card.........."üò≤üò≤üò≤üò≤üò≤üò≤

*MORAL: Always respect the hobbies of your husband.*üòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòí

Story continues....

Wife took out her husband's credit card from purse and swiped it. Unfortunately he didn't block his own card.

*Moral: Don't underestimate the power and wisdom of your WIFE..*

Story continues...

After swiping, the machine indicated, 'ENTER THE PIN SENT TO YOUR MOBILE PHONE'.......

*Moral: When a man tends to lose, the machine is smart enough to save him!*

Story continues....

She smiled to herself and reached out for the mobile which rang in her purse.

It was her husband's phone showing the forwarded SMS.

She had taken it with the remote control so he doesn't call her during her shopping.

She bought her items and returned home happily.

*Moral: Don't underestimate a desperate woman!*üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑

Story continues....

On getting home, his car was gone.üòàüòàüòàüòàüòà

A note was pasted on the door

"Couldn't find the remote. Gone out with the boys to watch the premiership match. Will be home late. Call me on my phone if you need something".üòáüòáüòáüòá

Damn... He left with the house key too.

üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

*Moral: Don't try to control your husband.
You will always loseüòØüòØüòØüòØüòØüòØüòØüòØ

*Happy International Men's Day* to all Men .

9/23/20, 3:18 PM - Shruti Vora: It also depends upon how we use?
9/23/20, 3:19 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: Yes all upon us what we want to believe ir sure is dangerous place if not use wisely
9/23/20, 3:19 PM - Manan: Well jus think this discussion as an example ... Everyone is so close to phone. one message  and everyone picked up their phone...  The reason to keep phone near is social media
9/23/20, 3:19 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: I probably use watss app the most
9/23/20, 3:19 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: It's the urge to answer n look ( psychological)
9/23/20, 3:19 PM - Shruti Vora: Yes! We all are social media addicts
9/23/20, 3:20 PM - Manan: That guy acted perfectly.. becoming pray to social media usage on phone
9/23/20, 3:20 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: But it's not new
9/23/20, 3:21 PM - Manan: Yes it's not new
9/23/20, 3:21 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: It's only replacing in-person gossip and long phone calls
9/23/20, 3:21 PM - Manan: This discussion has been from last may be 10-15 years
9/23/20, 3:21 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: It's tapping off human pyschology
9/23/20, 3:21 PM - Manan: Aaje aapde aa joyu etle we will think bout this for week n den something new aavse etle we will forget this
9/23/20, 3:21 PM - Sonali Patel: Problem
9/23/20, 3:22 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: So it's not all bad like the show represented it
9/23/20, 3:22 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Today social media is spreading fake news. Before mainstream media did
9/23/20, 3:23 PM - Manan: It's upto individual to decide upto what level they wanna use social media for any information
9/23/20, 3:23 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Only difference is that people believed and heard one story which kept them United but the story was necessarily true
9/23/20, 3:23 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Not*
9/23/20, 3:23 PM - Shruti Vora: It all depends upon how you interpret it. If you feel like depressed or unhappy by looking at other people's pictures or stories on social media, that's a problem. But if you are learning and staying on top of new trends, news and positive things, its good.
9/23/20, 3:23 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: True
9/23/20, 3:23 PM - Manan: Even print media used to spread fake news..
9/23/20, 3:24 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Exactly
9/23/20, 3:24 PM - Manan: But you can't spend lot of hours on social media jus cuz u wanna know everything Everytime
9/23/20, 3:24 PM - Manan: All they are saying is control usage
9/23/20, 3:24 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: So the problem is instant response
9/23/20, 3:25 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Not really the platforms
9/23/20, 3:25 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: Chai pe charcha no topic che aa
9/23/20, 3:25 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Totally
9/23/20, 3:25 PM - Shruti Vora: Yes! The only complaint I have and has been is we are loosing human touch, one on one conversation and personal conversation because of cell phone
9/23/20, 3:26 PM - Shruti Vora: We don't call each other to wish birthdays anymore or just show up at someone's house to surprise them
9/23/20, 3:26 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: True like old days
9/23/20, 3:26 PM - Shruti Vora: Everything has become so superficial that most of the time there is no feeling involved
9/23/20, 3:26 PM - Manan: Agree have to in same family ma pan b day wish FB par Kare che... Even though sathe rehta hoy to pan... That brings to ego point
9/23/20, 3:26 PM - Shruti Vora: One person wishes and all other follows
9/23/20, 3:27 PM - Shruti Vora: Yes, if you don't wish someone on fb, you don't 'love' or 'care' for them
9/23/20, 3:28 PM - Manan: Let's discuss on this next weekend.. where we are meeting?
9/23/20, 3:28 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Yes

9/24/20, 2:01 PM - Manan: Palak,karan n rishi also spent on food n drink.. share yours also
9/24/20, 2:01 PM - Manan: I am ok either way.. let me know amount
9/24/20, 2:02 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: Maharshi spent 40( I think yesha n nannu didnt order second round)  on drink I only spent on food ( which was not shared ot was for me n kids )
9/24/20, 2:02 PM - Manan: Karan .. you got grill cheese
9/24/20, 2:04 PM - Karan: It was $8 lol
9/24/20, 2:05 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: Ok either way
9/24/20, 2:06 PM - Rishi Pancholi: Lets just split  evenly.  We already paid  for our kids on side which is not included..we will keep it separate.  Rest who has 1 kid not really  matter much..so divid evenly  by couple
9/24/20, 3:20 PM - Saurabh Desai: I paid for my food so I will pay separately to Dhaval for drinks. It‚Äôs around $25. I was not aware that we were sharing food when I ordered.
9/24/20, 3:28 PM - Manan: 181/5= 36 per couple
9/24/20, 3:28 PM - Manan: 10 per person
9/24/20, 3:42 PM - Saurabh Desai: Instead of doing 181/5, Just do (181-25)/4. I will pay $25 to Dhaval for drinks. 
Or I can add $40 (my food expense) to total but it will be more confusing.
9/24/20, 3:50 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: It will 39 among us 4 dhaval do share zelle vevmo whatever you prefer
9/24/20, 3:56 PM - Manan: Oh ok
9/24/20, 3:57 PM - Manan: Dhawal sent u 39 via venmo

10/29/20, 12:22 PM - Rishi Pancholi: *A tribute to President TRUMP. Hope he wins*.


Leonard William QC.
Economist.
Research Ferret.

There is no doubt that Trump is a BUFFOON !! I am sure most will agree! However !! read this:

The buffoon in the White House just brokered two Middle East Peace Accords, something that 71 years of political intervention and endless war failed to produce.

The buffoon in the White House is the first president that has not engaged us in a foreign war since Eisenhower.

The buffoon in the White House has had the greatest impact on the economy, bringing jobs, and lowering unemployment to the Black and Latino population of ANY other president. Ever.

The buffoon in the White House has exposed the deep, widespread, and long-standing corruption in the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, and the Republican and Democratic parties.

The buffoon in the White House turned NATO around and had them start paying their dues.

The buffoon in the White House neutralized the North Koreans, stopped them from developing a further nuclear capability, sending missiles toward Japan, and threatening the West Coast of the US.

The Buffoon in the White House turned our relationship to the Chinese around, brought hundreds of business back to the US, and revived the economy. Hello.

The buffoon in the White House has accomplished the appointing of two Supreme Court Justices and close to 300 Federal Judges.

The buffoon in the White House lowered your taxes and caused your stock market to move to record levels over 100 times, positively impacting the retirements of tens of millions of citizens.

The buffoon in the White House fast-tracked the development of a COVID Vaccine - it will be available within weeks - we still don't have a vaccine for SARS, Bird Flu, Ebola, or a host of diseases that arose during previous administrations.

The buffoon in the White House rebuilt our military which the Obama administration had crippled and had fired 214 key generals and admirals in his first year of office.

The buffoon in the White House uncovered widespread paedophilia in the government and in Hollywood. the buffoon in the White House is exposing worldwide sex trafficking of minors and bringing children home to their families.

The buffoon in the White House. Works for free and has lost well over 2 billion dollars of his own money in serving - and done all of this and much more in the face of relentless undermining and opposition from people who are threatened because they know they are going to be exposed as the criminals that they are if he is re-elected.


74 years old. A billionaire. Doesn‚Äôt need a cent. Could be on a beach anywhere in the world. Has worked his whole life.
Raised children who have work ethics out of this world.

Have you ever wondered if you were 74 years old, a billionaire, and diagnosed with covid, if you would still be showing up, fighting for a country where millions of the citizens hated you?

And if the opposition get into the White House, any US support for Australia against the threats from China will be gone - a loss for India.

11/5/20, 1:17 PM - Manan: After death, George Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump are going for a  interview with God.

God asks Bush, "What do you believe in?"

Bush answers, "I believe in the free market, and the strong American nation!"

God is impressed by Bush and tells him, "Great , come sit on the chair on my right" 

Next, God asks Obama, "What do you believe in?"

Obama answers, "I believe in the power of democracy, helping the poor, world peace, etc."

God is really impressed by Obama and tells him, "Well done , come sit on the chair on my left.

Finally, God asks Trump, "What do you believe in?"

Trump answers, "I believe you're sitting on my chair." ü§®

11/6/20, 1:28 PM - Sonali Patel: Trump, helped lower our economical burdens overseas however he translated that over to the wealthy only.  He also hurt our presence in world affairs by doing this because without money there is no power.
11/6/20, 1:28 PM - Rishi Pancholi: Obama doesn't  had gut to bring it back
11/6/20, 1:28 PM - Sonali Patel: Yes that is absolutely true. But it is also filled by our greed and our need for cheap food and cheap items
11/6/20, 1:29 PM - Sonali Patel: Are you seriously going to tell me that you are willing to pay and make sure 10 to $15 on essential items just because it's made in the United States? I highly doubt it most of us are shopping in Walmart, Target where majority of their products are made in China.
11/6/20, 1:29 PM - Rishi Pancholi: We living in world where  China can fo business  in America and trade  freely  but us not allow to sell  Apple or Google there
11/6/20, 1:29 PM - Rishi Pancholi: Usa has all abilit
11/6/20, 1:29 PM - Sonali Patel: I do not see organic and biodegradable tableware at the last party, I saw plastic and foam. All of which are massly produced in China
11/6/20, 1:29 PM - Rishi Pancholi: Without  try considering  failure  is actually  failure
11/6/20, 1:29 PM - Sonali Patel: And didn't you just buy an Audi?

11/6/20, 1:34 PM - Sonali Patel: Not necessarily, you can easily find american-made and other foreign-made products perhaps a little bit more pricier but you can find them
11/6/20, 1:34 PM - Rishi Pancholi: That's why changing  government needed so they stop so I stop
11/6/20, 1:34 PM - Rishi Pancholi: Not talking about any other  free trade contry
11/6/20, 1:38 PM - Sonali Patel: When Bill Clinton made it easier for American companies to outsource their work to secure cheap labor, this is what happened.  Along with the Chinese outsource of labor, we also saw an increase in Mexican labor, the IT industry boom in India, the increasing retail in Vietnam Cambodia and Indonesia. We also saw at the same time what we saw in the United States during the early 1900s which is a decrease in the quality of life of those workers. But if you pay your workers more, we have to pay more for the final product which majority of the United States population is not willing to do.

1/19/21, 8:56 AM - Off to Europe >>>I Go>>>: Masterfully summarized By Pratishtha Akkanawru

I don't think we understand what really happened today. Yes, India did win. India did win in Australia, India did win it with half their team in bandages, but it's a lot bigger than that. 

As humans, we want David to beat Goliath.  It took India almost their entire cricket history, till they finally beat Australia at their home, in 2018. But then the men in Baggy Green were without Smith and Warner. This time the Aussies brought all their arsenal. They pummeled, punched, bowled out India for a shocking 36 in Adelaide. How do you recover mentally, physically, psychologically from that? Oh and your captain and the best batsman in the world is unavailable for the remainder of the series. 

And that is why this series is probably so much more special for India than any before.

There is a man who in the Melbourne game was racially abused by a small section of the crowd - Mohammed Siraj. Four years back when he was selected for the IPL, he had only one dream - to never let his father drive an auto again. Last month, while he was still waiting to play his first test in Australia, his father died. Siraj could not go back for the funeral. For the last few months, Siraj has been holding his father's illness, the abuse, the heckling,  the insecurities regarding a youngster's selection all together and yesterday he burst and picked five wickets in the second innings setting up the game for India. When he kissed the ground and the tears flowed, we should have known we were up for something special.

There is a man who has been criticized, heckled, trolled, made fun of in social media, by experts, almost everyone for almost one and a half years now. He scored a brilliant 97 in Melbourne and almost got India to victory. But 'almost' is not remembered in history. Today, he scored an unbeaten 89 and took India to arguably one of their greatest wins. Rishabh Pant.

There is a man who has been hit on the body a thousand times throughout the series, and when he goes into the shower tonight, there will be bruises, cuts and lumps on his arms, chest, thighs and more. He might not be celebrated half as much as Kohli, Sharma, or even Gill or Pant, but when he does hang up his boots eventually, his contribution to Indian cricket would be right at the top. Cheteshwar Pujara.

There is a boy who is just 21 years old and probably doesn't realize that it's not okay to hit 91 in the fourth innings in Gabba against the likes of Cummins, Hazelwood and Starc. Sacrilege, Shubhman Gill, sacrilege. Why does youth know no fear. Why is youth so expressive, so uninhibited. 

There is a man who has captained India in the absence of Kohli, showed none of the verbal aggression that he does, but is every bit as passionate. He appears calm, but fought his way through a hundred demons, detractors (Shastri-the biggest of all) set up the win in Sydney and marshalled whatever players were left, superbly. Rahane. 

There are two men playing their first test matches and scoring half centuries in the lower half of the Indian batting order and then picking up wickets, as if they were playing school matches, not test cricket. Washington Sundar and Shardul Thakur. Who wrote your script, boys.

It is not just that India won. India did not have 11 of their main players (Kohli, Bumrah, Ashwin, Shami, Ishant, Vihari, Yadav, Jadeja, Dhawan, Rahul) and yet the team fought, soldiered, counter punched, resisted, took blows, and never gave up. India did not win the series because of beautiful strokes. India won it in because of an incredible amount of bloody mindedness in their heads and pluck in their hearts. What Washington, Shardul, Gill, Natarajan have done is give hope to thousands of boys in India today that some day even they can play for India.

It's what sports is all about - fighting, being fair, dreaming, surviving, and inspiring. In true Bollywood style, it took the entire two months, the last session of the last day of the last test match, to deliver a verdict. And even then for most parts of the day, we were never really sure whether India would lose, win or draw the game. All this in a stadium where Australia hasn't lost for 32 years. 

For the whole day, I was frantic, nervous, tense, till Pant hit that winning four (I have no nails left). Watching him carry the Indian flag around the ground, watching Rahane ruffle his hair and laugh, is what sports is all about no? Actually, this is what life is about - you fall, you get up, you fight, and you SHALL WIN!

2/8/21, 8:27 AM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: I am suggesting this property please take a look
2/8/21, 8:29 AM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: I personally think this will work with our larger group we just have to accommodate in better way if we had gone out with family we would hv adjusted so I am requesting to do the same
2/8/21, 8:31 AM - Manan: House is ok.. check out distance.. 50 mile
2/8/21, 8:32 AM - Manan: If we are picking this one.. might as well adjust into current one
2/8/21, 8:33 AM - Manan: Or also we can do minor tweak for 2 families who will be sharing room.. can pay half and other 4 couple picks up other two couples half share.... Jus a thought...
2/8/21, 8:35 AM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: That's fine too if we are ok with current house I am ok with it
2/8/21, 8:35 AM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: Let me as if there is extra mattress there that we can use
2/8/21, 8:38 AM - Manan: That way other families don't feel that they are not getting whole room to them selves.. but in that case other 4 couple ll have to pick up 540 extra

3/10/21, 11:09 AM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: *Adult Fairy Tale*üòâ

Once upon a time there lived a King. 

The King had a beautiful daughter, The PRINCESS..

But there was a problem. 

Everything the Princess touched would melt.
 
No matter what; 
Metal, 
Wood, 
Stone, 
Anything she touched would melt.

Because of this, men were afraid of her.

Nobody would dare marry her.

The King despaired.

What could he do to help his daughter ?

He consulted his wizards and magicians. 

One wizard told the King, 
'If your daughter touches one thing that does not melt in her hands, she will be cured.'

The King was overjoyed and came up with a plan.

The next day, he held a competition. 

Any man that could bring his daughter an object that would not melt would marry her and inherit the King's wealth...

THREE YOUNG PRINCES TOOK UP THE CHALLENGE.

The first brought a sword of the finest steel. 
But alas, when the Princess touched it, it melted. 
The prince went away sadly .

The second prince brought diamonds.

He thought diamonds are the hardest substance in the world and would not melt. 

But alas, once the Princess touched them, they melted.

He too was sent away disappointed.

The third prince approached. 

He told the Princess, Put your hand in my pocket and feel what is in there.'

The Princess did as she was told, though she turned red .

She felt something hard. 
She held it in her hand. 
And it did not melt !!!

The King was overjoyed. 

Everybody in the kingdom was overjoyed.

And the third Prince married the Princess and they both lived happily ever after.

Question: What was in the Prince's pants ?

4/26/21, 1:46 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: Our departure is at 6:10 so we are good
4/26/21, 1:46 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Manan, just call them and get it changed if needed
4/26/21, 1:46 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: They should be able to do it
4/26/21, 1:47 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Unless it is adding a day of rental but it shouldn't
4/26/21, 1:47 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Oh nm
4/26/21, 1:47 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: I guess we don't need to

Why is only India so badly affected by COVID this time in the Indian subcontinent?

Answered by Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam

March 2020 - Fosun Pharma of China invests $135 Million with BioNTECH to collaborate and develop 300 Million Doses of MRNA Vaccines;

May 2020 - US Federal Govt invests $12 Billion into six pharma companies to collaborate and develop vaccines for the US population under warp speed;

EU invests $210 Million with AstraZeneca and Oxford to develop vaccines;

Russia invests $ 125 Million to develop Vaccines by Gamalaya Institute;

China invests $ 562 Million to four pharma companies to develop and design vaccines;

What did GOI do???

Banged on plates !!!!!!

Argued about the death of an actor and his manager.

Arrested people for possessing weed.

It was God's luck that AZ chose SII to manufacture a billion doses and Poonawala made a cross deal that out of these billion doses he would supply a tenth, or 10%, to the Govt of India.

Even then we did not place any orders. Modi could have placed an order right then for 1 billion doses and paid $ 2.18 billion, but NO!!!

In Chetan Bhagat's words - We always think we can do JUGAAD!!!

Sep 2020 - Covaxin thinks it can develop vaccines. Yet GOI does'nt invest 50 paise in Bharat Biotech to scale up operations

Nov 2020 - Sinovac, Sinopharm, Sputnik, AZ and Pfizer and Moderna have all paid off their investments. Their vaccines are READY!!!!!!

What does India do?

Still refuses to place orders for vaccines from SII.

Still don't place orders from Bharat Biotech for Covaxin

Play Diwali

Pass loony farm laws and cause a buildup of people for months and months and months.

Jan - March 2021 - China, Russia, US, EU begin mass vaccinations thanks to steady supply of vaccines already collaborated and ordered.

What does India do?

India gets doses from SII as part of its AZ deal (Not one order from GOI yet)

India makes speech that India will save humanity.

India exports 25 Million Doses for free out of its 100 million doses to neighbors as part of vaccine diplomacy.

SII as a private company exports 34 million doses to the EU and 18 Million doses to WHO under Covax (nothing to do with GOI)

Election rallies!!! TN, WB, Kerala all with rallies under an IMPOTENT ELECTION COMMISSION. Not one word about masks or safety etc.

Still not 1 order placed with AZ or SII by GOI !

April 2021 - All Vaccination programs in US, EU, China, Russia are going strongly with 4‚Äì5 vaccines developed and enough materials secured.

What does India do?

Hijack vaccines meant and paid for by other countries and prevent exports. GOI hijacked 100 million vaccines meant for EU (78 Million) and WHO (22 Million). This caused huge delays for Poonawala with EU.

Meanwhile the Kumbh Mela is celebrated with pomp and joy.

The Bungler Supremo chants Didi o Didi with 1.8 lakh cases a day and rising.

Finally GOI pay for the 100 Million Vaccines they ‚ÄúHijacked‚Äù and order another 110 million vaccines. Even now they don't place orders for 400‚Äì500‚Äì600 Million but 110 million!!!!!

GOI, under pressure, grants SII - Rs. 3000 Crore.

Situation Today

US is beautifully poised to vaccinate 60% willing adults by July 2021;

EU is poised to vaccinate 70% of all adults by 2021 September (Not July);

China is on the way to vaccinate 40% of its population plus a further 200 Million of the world's population by September 2021;

Russia is on the way to vaccinate 50% of its population by Sep 2021 plus a further 700 Million of the world's population by Dec 2021;

Poonawala has fled India.

We have no supply for vaccines except through begging from the whole world like harlots.

We have only 11 Crore orders from SII paid for yet we demand more commitments from him for 200‚Äì400 Million doses. He won't come back. He may likely take British Citizenship and fulfill his AZ orders to WHO (82 Million) and EU;

We have 400000 cases a day and 4000 deaths a day!!!!!

So what did India not do ?

Collaborate and invest in a vaccine with a top pharma company like the rest of the governments did.

Hi ‚ÄãPalak,

‚Äã

‚ÄãThank you for choosing Car Rental 8.

‚Äã

Yes, there is a cost for the additional driver. You would add them at the counter directly with the Thrifty agent who would also collect the payment at that time. The additional driver is about $15 per day.

‚Äã

Please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions or concerns.


With kind regards,¬†

6/11/21, 10:20 AM - Manan: A  Sindhi couple went to a Sex Therapist office at a BIG Corporate Hospital.

The doctor asked,"What can I do for you?"

The man said,"Will you watch us having sex, for your expert analysis?"

The doctor looked puzzled, but agreed.

When the couple finished, the doctor said,"There's nothing wrong with the way you have intercourse," and charged them Rs.1300.

This happened several weeks in a row. The couple would make an appointment, have intercourse with no problems, pay the doctor and then leave.

Finally the doctor asked," exactly what are you trying to find out?"

The man said, ."We're not trying to find out anything. She's married and we can't go to her house I'm married and we can't go to my house. 

The Oberoi charges Rs. 15000,

Taj charges Rs.14000 ,

Le Meridian charges Rs.12500.

We do it here for Rs.1300,

Punch line is yet to come..........

This is one of the best suspense jokes üòú

A Father put his 3year old daughter to bed, told her a story and listened to her prayers which ended by saying, 
"God bless Mommy, God bless Daddy, God bless Grandma and good-bye Grandpa."

The father asked, 'Why did you say good-bye Grandpa?'

The little girl said, "I don't know daddy, it just seemed like the thing to do."

The next day grandpa died. 
The father thought it was a strange coincidence.

A few months later the father put the girl to bed and listened to her prayers which went like this, "God bless Mommy, God Bless Daddy and good-bye Grandma."

The next day the grandmother died.

"Holy crap" thought the father, "this kid is in contact with the other side."

Several weeks later when the girl was going to bed the dad heard her say, "God bless Mommy and good-bye Daddy."

He practically went into shock. He couldn't sleep all night and got up at the crack of dawn to go to his office. 

He was nervous as a cat all day, had lunch and watched the clock.. He figured if he could get by until midnight he would be okay. 

He felt safe in the office, so instead of going home at the end of the day he stayed there, drinking coffee, looking at his watch and jumping at every sound. Finally midnight arrived; he breathed a sigh of relief and went home.

When he got home his wife said, "I've never seen you work so late. What's the matter?"

He said, "I don't want to talk about it, I've just spent the worst day of my life."

She said, "You think you had a bad day, you'll never believe what happened to me. This morning my boss died in the middle of a meeting!"

7/9/21, 12:51 PM - +1 (951) 809-3468: @16263749249  Fiesta Americana is one of the top rated. It was sold out when I checked yesterday. If you can find a good deal with Costco, then would be good
7/9/21, 12:54 PM - Sonali Patel: I think $1200 or so is ok for all inclusive
7/9/21, 1:01 PM - Saurabh Desai: So right now it‚Äôs available I was able to continue further. I will email them and see what group deal they can give us and at which resorts.
7/9/21, 1:03 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: La estancia is also good
7/9/21, 1:04 PM - Saurabh Desai: In Costco case for most of them transportation is included and Costco gift card is included. Also I think once we select couple of resorts we should check directly with them for all inclusive deal for group if possible.

7/11/21, 1:37 PM - Saurabh Desai: Costco only does group booking for cruises. There are 4 options from Costco for all inclusive. Occidental Nuevo Vallarta - All-Inclusive is 3 star ($999). Fiesta Americana Puerto Vallarta Hotel & Spa - All-Inclusive is 3.5 star ($1283). Now Amber Puerto Vallarta - All-Inclusive is 4 star ($1327). Dreams Villamagna Nuevo Vallarta - All-Inclusive is 4 star ($1421). I did check the Now Amber directly and without all inclusive their total was coming out to be same as what Costco is offering. These prices are for 2 adults and 1 kid. For Palak and Ami price will be higher from $100 to $300 based on resort we pick. If interested We need to look into kids activities and food options and then choose the resort.

12/2/21, 2:27 PM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: Do you need a COVID test to enter Mexico?

No. You do not need a COVID test to enter Mexico, and you also do not need to quarantine once you‚Äôve arrived in Mexico.

Although you don‚Äôt need to be vaccinated to travel to Mexico, the CDC recommends that you get fully vaccinated before traveling abroad. Unvaccinated travelers should avoid nonessential travel to Mexico. 

It is also not required that travelers be fully vaccinated to return to the United States, but you will need approved documentation of a negative COVID-19 test result.

You will need to present documented proof of a negative result collected within a three-day window of your departure flight date. If you are visiting Puerto Vallarta, we recommend our CityHealth COVID testing site at Biomedical Center downtown. It‚Äôs easy to get to, offers convenient online appointment booking, and a travel-ready Digital Health Certificate will be securely emailed to you within half an hour of your test. And the best part ‚Äì you‚Äôll save the hours-long lineups for travel testing at the airport on your way home.

12/31/21, 8:56 AM - Rishi Pancholi: I asked my friend who was having a Rs 60000/- bike, which fuel he was using. 
He replied, it's Petrol. 

When I asked why don't you try Kerosene?  His reply was, the engine will be spoiled. 

I again asked him, do you drink alcohol?? 

He quietly said 'yes'.

When I questioned, won't it spoil your engine??? 

He humbly replied, it's only occasionally... 

My question is, can we pour kerosene occasionally in our bike for a change??? 

No - we cannot. 

We give more value to our Rs 60000 bike but not for our life. 

Our life is more valuable and more Important.

DNA Testing Reveals Milkman Fathered Over 800 Children Between 1951 And 1964

December 24, 2021¬†Bonine

https://dailynewsreported.com/romance/dna-testing-reveals-milkman-fathered-over-800-children-between-1951-and-1964/

Randall (Randy) Jeffries was a Milk Delivery man in the 1950‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs in Southern California. His route was in the San Diego area. Back in those days milk delivery was how we got our milk. No quick runs to the store or jaunts to the nearest Walmart. Week in and week out, Randy pounded the pavement from truck to doorstep.

Over the years he began to form relationships with his customers and in those times the vast majority of his interactions were with housewives. He was quite a handsome man back in his time and many were the customer who would request him. Frequently pies and casseroles were made for him.

A lot of woman were wives of servicemen and Randy was the most consistent man in their lives. Overtime pies and casseroles turned into creampies and blowjobs. Now this was not common knowledge back then. People were discreet in their affairs and the absence of technology and paper trails made a covert love affair all the more successful.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually in DNA research, so finding out Randal is my father and the fact it came to fruition through DNA testing makes it all the sweeter!‚Äù, Dr. Simon Simmons

During those years it was not unusual to find a child with different color hair than their siblings. Now with the advent of home DNA kits to test your ancestry, more and more people are finding skeletons in their family tree‚Äôs closets. A rash of adults in the San Diego area had controversial DNA test results in where it was clear that their father was not of blood relation. This led to all kinds of chaos.

After some digging and research by a former FBI profiler, Randall Jeffries was DNA tested as a possible contributor to at least some of the births in question. After hundreds of tests and re-tests, it was show that Mr. Jeffries did in-fact sire upwards of 800+ children. Because of their ages and laws at time of conception, Randy was clear of any and all legal charges they may have stemmed from missed child-support or the like.

‚ÄúAll these years I thought I was sterile. My wife and I never had any children. To think that at age 97, to hear such news! What a blessing. I now feel so fulfilled and cannot wait to meet all my children‚Äú, says Randy.

1/15/22, 11:15 AM - Palak Pancholi/Thakore: The best times to visit Banff are June to August and December to March. Nature lovers will want to get to the park when the weather is warm and welcoming (and while the hotel rates in town are at a reasonable level). The skiers, however, will want to vacation in the height of winter.
1/15/22, 11:15 AM - Yesha: Banff expects on average 6 hours of sunshine per day in May. On average, there are 4 days of snow and foggy weather expected throughout this month in Banff. However towards the end of May the weather starts to warm up and all the lakes that froze over in the colder months will start to melt.

But, This good news doesn't get reported in newspaper.*

*Because US arm industry doesn't want to loose the opportunity of supplying arms and ammunition to the World, in the name of war.*

*Kissinger said - America has no permanent friends & enemies, only interests.*

World operates on very different terms than we common people believe.

4/9/22, 9:45 AM - +1 (951) 809-3468: Moonwalk by Bryan Smith is part of a *National Geographic Channel series*!called The Man Who Can Fly.

This particular scene features Late Dean Potter (pictured below), a record-breaking climber who lives in Yosemite, walking on a highline between *two enormous granite rocks.*

For over a year, Potter insisted that the moon would provide a stunning backdrop for the stunt, and convinced *photographer Mikey Schaefer* to capture the shot.

*Using a Canon 5D Mark II * and an 800mm, f/5.6 lens with a 2X doubler as well as an app called The Photographer‚Äôs Ephemeris, Schaefer found the exact point where the moon would rise.

He set himself up on an *adjacent ridge* 1.2 miles from Cathedral Peak at 7:30 p.m., affording him the perfect balance of exposure between Potter and the moon
